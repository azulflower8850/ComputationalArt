# ComputationalArt
For this project, I used randomly generated lambda functions and a time function to create videos of cool art moving through time. The functions are completely randomly generated utilizing a set of base functions, including product, sine, cosine, and absolute functions. The video in the repository is a nice demo of my work, showing an example of transformational art.
